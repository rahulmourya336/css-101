              Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (/ˈɡɑːndi, ˈɡændi/; 2 October 1869 – 30
              January 1948) was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist,
              and political ethicist, who employed nonviolent resistance to lead
              the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule,
              and in turn inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the
              world. The honorific Mahātmā (Sanskrit: "great-souled", "venerable"),
              first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa, is now used throughout
              the world
            </p>
    
            <p>
              Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, western India,
              Gandhi trained in law at the Inner Temple, London, and was called to
              the bar at age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain years in India,
              during which he was unable to start a successful law practice, he
              moved to South Africa in 1893 (to represent an Indian merchant in a
              lawsuit), where he stayed for 21 years. It was in South Africa that
              Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a
              campaign for civil rights.
            </p>
    
            <p>
              The same year Gandhi adopted the Indian loincloth, or short dhoti and,
              in the winter, a shawl, both woven with yarn hand-spun on a
              traditional Indian spinning wheel, or charkha, as a mark of
              identification with India's rural poor. Thereafter, he lived modestly
              in a self-sufficient residential community, ate simple vegetarian
              food, and undertook long fasts as a means of self-purification and
              political protest.

          Norman Ernest Borlaug (/ˈbɔːrlɔːɡ/; March 25, 1914 – September 12,
          2009) was an American agronomist who led initiatives worldwide that
          contributed to the extensive increases in agricultural production
          termed the Green Revolution. Borlaug was awarded multiple honors for
          his work, including the Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of
          Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal.
        </p>

        <p>
          Borlaug received his B.S. in forestry in 1937 and Ph.D. in plant
          pathology and genetics from the University of Minnesota in 1942. He
          took up an agricultural research position with CIMMYT in Mexico, where
          he developed semi-dwarf, high-yield, disease-resistant wheat
          varieties. During the mid-20th century, Borlaug led the introduction
          of these high-yielding varieties combined with modern agricultural
          production techniques to Mexico, Pakistan, and India. As a result,
          Mexico became a net exporter of wheat by 1963. Between 1965 and 1970,
          wheat yields nearly doubled in Pakistan and India, greatly improving
          the food security in those nations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Borlaug was often called "the father of the Green Revolution",
          and is credited with saving over a billion people worldwide from
          starvation.] According to Jan Douglas, executive assistant
          to the president of the World Food Prize Foundation, the source of
          this number is Gregg Easterbrook's 1997 article "Forgotten Benefactor
          of Humanity." The article states that the "form of agriculture that
          Borlaug preaches may have prevented a billion deaths."] He was
          awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 in recognition of his
          contributions to world peace through increasing food supply.
